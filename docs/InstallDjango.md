#  What is Django

Django is a free and open source web application framework, written in Python. A web framework is a set of components that helps you to develop websites faster and easier.

When you're building a website, you always need a similar set of components: a way to handle user authentication (signing up, signing in, signing out), a management panel for your website, forms, a way to upload files, etc.

Luckily for you, other people long ago noticed that web developers face similar problems when building a new site, so they teamed up and created frameworks (Django being one of them) that give you ready-made components to use.

Frameworks exist to save you from having to reinvent the wheel and to help alleviate some of the overhead when youâ€™re building a new site.

# What is pip ?

**pip** is a package management system used to install and manage software packages written in Python.

 In the installation above, the version is explicitly mentioned (i.e 2.0.5). If you didn't mentioned the version, pip will automatically download the latest version of the package.
 This repository works on Django version 2.0.5 that's why I want you to install this version.
