# How to install Django

This guide will walk you through on how to install Django on your machine.

## Requirements

* Python 3(+) (download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you havn't already.)


## Installation

* Open command prompt, and type in:

`pip install django==2.0.5`

* This will install Django  version 2.0.5 on your computer.

### Overview

 **pip** is a package manager, it allows us to download and install packages. An alternative of pip is **conda**.

 In the installation above, the version is explicitly mentioned (i.e 2.0.5). If you didn't mentioned the version, pip will automatically download the latest version of the package.
 This repository works on Django version 2.0.5 that's why I want you to install this version.
